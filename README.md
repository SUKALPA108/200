Got it — you need clean pointwise notes to explain your project confidently in an interview.
Here’s a powerful, structured answer set you can study and speak from:

Project: HRMS Communication Service (Microservice)


---

1. Introduction

Built a Spring Boot based microservice called Communication Service.

Handles internal Surveys and Messages between employees in an HRMS (Human Resource Management System).

Exposed REST APIs and tested everything via Swagger UI.

Project connected to a MySQL Database for persistence.



---

2. Tech Stack

Backend: Java 17, Spring Boot

Database: MySQL

API Documentation: Springdoc OpenAPI 3 + Swagger UI

Tools: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse, Maven

Server: Embedded Tomcat (port 8087)



---

3. Modules Developed

Survey Management

Create Surveys

Get All Surveys

Get Survey by ID


Message Management

Create Messages

Get All Messages




---

4. Database Design

Survey Table

id (Primary Key, auto-generated)

question (String)

options (String)

createdBy (String)


Message Table

id (Primary Key, auto-generated)

subject (String)

body (String)

sender (String)

receiver (String)




---

5. Project Architecture

Entity Layer: Represents database tables.

Repository Layer: Extends JpaRepository to perform CRUD operations.

Service Layer: Business logic handled here (interfaces and implementations).

Controller Layer: REST API endpoints exposed.

DTO Layer: Introduced to transfer specific data safely without exposing full entities.



---

6. Key Features

Swagger UI Integration

Automatically generated API docs at http://localhost:8087/swagger-ui.html

Easy testing of all endpoints.


DTO (Data Transfer Object) Usage

Created SurveyDTO and MessageDTO.

Controllers now accept DTOs instead of directly accepting Entities.

Mapped DTO fields to Entity objects inside Controllers before saving.


Standard Response Handling

Used ResponseEntity to return HTTP status codes like 201 Created, 200 OK, etc.




---

7. Swagger Endpoints Overview

Survey Management APIs

GET /api/surveys — Fetch all surveys

POST /api/surveys — Create a new survey

GET /api/surveys/{id} — Fetch a specific survey by ID


Message Management APIs

GET /api/messages — Fetch all messages

POST /api/messages — Create a new message




---

8. Swagger Testing Example

For POST /api/surveys:

Example Payload:

{
  "question": "What benefits do you expect?",
  "options": "Health Insurance, Bonus, Remote Work",
  "createdBy": "admin@hrms.com"
}


For POST /api/messages:

Example Payload:

{
  "subject": "Holiday Notice",
  "body": "Company will be closed on 1st May.",
  "sender": "admin@hrms.com",
  "receiver": "all@hrms.com"
}




---

9. Important Development Practices Used

Used Layered Architecture (Entity → Repository → Service → Controller).

Separated DTOs from Entities for security and flexibility.

Implemented Exception Handling (basic; can be extended to a GlobalExceptionHandler).

Used Environment Variables via application.properties for server port and database credentials.

Proper Maven Dependency Management for OpenAPI/Swagger integration.



---

10. Deployment and Usage

The project is self-contained inside a .zip file.

Can be imported into any IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ) and run directly.

Works on any device if MySQL and JDK 17+ are installed and database connection is correctly configured.

How to Quickly Explain in Interview (Summary Style)

Sample quick speech:

> "I have developed a Spring Boot microservice called Communication Service for an HRMS system. It manages Surveys and Messages between employees. I used a layered architecture separating Entities, DTOs, Repositories, Services, and Controllers. I integrated Swagger UI for API testing and created a MySQL database for persistent storage. DTOs are used to safely transfer data. APIs are documented and tested successfully. The project can be deployed easily using Maven and runs on embedded Tomcat server. I followed best practices like using ResponseEntity, Layered Coding, and DTO design patterns."
